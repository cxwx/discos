**      eral      double    "local" Earth Rotation Angle (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**   1) It is advisable to take great care with units, as even unlikely
**      values of the input parameters are accepted and processed in
**      accordance with the models used.
**
**   2) The utc argument is UTC expressed as an MJD.  This is,
**      strictly speaking, improper, because of leap seconds.  However,
**      as long as the delta UT and the UTC are consistent there are no
**      difficulties, except during a leap second.  In this case, the
**      start of the 61st second of the final minute should begin a new
**      MJD day and the old pre-leap delta UT should continue to be
**      used.  As the 61st second completes, the MJD should revert to
**      the start of the day as, simultaneously, the delta UTC changes
**      by one second to its post-leap new value.
**
**   3) The delta UT (UT1-UTC) is tabulated in IERS bulletins.  It
**      increases by exactly one second at the end of each UTC leap
**      second, introduced in order to keep delta UT within +/- 0.9s.
**
**   4) IMPORTANT -- TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN CONVENTION.
**      The longitude required by the present function is east-positive,
**      in accordance with geographical convention (and right-handed).
**      In particular, note that the longitudes returned by the
**      slaObs function are west-positive, following astronomical
**      usage, and must be reversed in sign before use in the present
**      function.
**
**   5) The polar motion coordinates xp,yp can be obtained from IERS
**      bulletins.  The maximum amplitude is about 0.3 arcseconds.  If
**      xp,yp values are unavailable, use zeroes.  The xp,yp
**      coordinates are reckoned as follows:
**
**      . +ve xp means that the point on the geoid directly beneath
**        the CIP is in the hemisphere centered on longitude 90 deg.
**
**      . +ve yp means that the point on the geoid directly beneath
**        the CIP is in the hemisphere centered on longitude 270 deg.
**
**      Internally, the polar motion is stored in a form rotated onto
**      the local meridian.
**
**   6) The height above sea level of the observing station, hm, can be
**      obtained from the Astronomical Almanac (Section J in the 1988
**      edition), or via the function slaObs.  If p, the pressure in
**      hPa (millibars), is available, an adequate estimate of hm can be
**      obtained from the expression
**
**            hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( p / 1013.25 );
**
**      where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
**      (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
**      52).  Similarly, if the pressure p is not known, it can be
**      estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
**      follows:
**
**            p = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
**
**      Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
**      the pressure and that an accurate p value is important for
**      precise work.
**
**   7) The "adjusted longitude" ioprms->along is the observer's
**      longitude plus the tiny quantity s' plus the small amount of ERA
**      that corresponds to the current UT1-UTC.
**
**   8) The "local Earth rotation angle" ioprms->eral is ERA plus the
**      adjusted longitude.
**
**   9) Repeated, computationally-expensive, calls to slaI2opa for
**      times that are very close together can be avoided by calling
**      slaI2opa just once and then using slaI2opat for the subsequent
**      times.  Fresh calls to slaI2opa will be needed only when changes
**      in the polar motion have grown to unacceptable levels or when
**      anything affecting the refraction has changed.
**
**  10) The argument wlfq specifies whether the refraction corrections
**      are for the optical or radio, and the wavelength/frequency.
**      Positive values specify wavelength in microns and are the usual
**      way of selecting the optical case.  Negative values specify
**      frequency in GHz and are the usual way of selecting the radio
**      case.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to occur
**      at 100 microns (about 3000 GHz).
