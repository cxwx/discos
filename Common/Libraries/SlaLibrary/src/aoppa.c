**       (12)     longitude + eqn of equinoxes + sidereal DUT (radians)
**       (13)     local apparent sidereal time (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**   1)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even
**       unlikely values of the input parameters are accepted and
**       processed in accordance with the models used.
**
**   2)  The date argument is UTC expressed as an MJD.  This is,
**       strictly speaking, improper, because of leap seconds.  However,
**       as long as the delta UT and the UTC are consistent there
**       are no difficulties, except during a leap second.  In this
**       case, the start of the 61st second of the final minute should
**       begin a new MJD day and the old pre-leap delta UT should
**       continue to be used.  As the 61st second completes, the MJD
**       should revert to the start of the day as, simultaneously,
**       the delta UTC changes by one second to its post-leap new value.
**
**   3)  The delta UT (UT1-UTC) is tabulated in IERS circulars and
**       elsewhere.  It increases by exactly one second at the end of
**       each UTC leap second, introduced in order to keep delta UT
**       within +/- 0.9 seconds.
**
**   4)  IMPORTANT -- TAKE CARE WITH THE LONGITUDE SIGN CONVENTION.
**       The longitude required by the present function is
**       east-positive in accordance with geographical convention (and
**       right-handed).  In particular, note that the longitudes
**       returned by the slaObs function are west-positive, following
**       astronomical usage, and must be reversed in sign before use in
**       the present function.
**
**   5)  The polar coordinates xp,yp can be obtained from IERS
**       circulars and equivalent publications.  The maximum amplitude
**       is about 0.3 arcseconds.  If xp,yp values are unavailable,
**       use xp=yp=0.0.  See page B60 of the 1988 Astronomical Almanac
**       for a definition of the two angles.
**
**   6)  The height above sea level of the observing station, hm,
**       can be obtained from the Astronomical Almanac (Section J
**       in the 1988 edition), or via the function slaObs.  If p,
**       the pressure in hPa (millibars), is available, an adequate
**       estimate of hm can be obtained from the expression
**
**             hm = -29.3 * tsl * log ( p / 1013.25 );
**
**       where tsl is the approximate sea-level air temperature in K
**       (See Astrophysical Quantities, C.W.Allen, 3rd edition, section
**       52).  Similarly, if the pressure p is not known, it can be
**       estimated from the height of the observing station, hm, as
**       follows:
**
**             p = 1013.25 * exp ( -hm / ( 29.3 * tsl ) );
**
**       Note, however, that the refraction is nearly proportional to
**       the pressure and that an accurate p value is important for
**       precise work.
**
**   7)  Repeated, computationally-expensive, calls to slaAoppa for
**       times that are very close together can be avoided by calling
**       slaAoppa just once and then using slaAoppat for the subsequent
**       times.  Fresh calls to slaAoppa will be needed only when
**       changes in the equation of the equinoxes or the polar motion
**       have grown to unacceptable levels or when anything affecting
**       the refraction has changed.
**
**   8)  The argument wlfq specifies whether the refraction corrections
**       are for the optical or radio, and the wavelength/frequency.
**       Positive values specify wavelength in microns and are the usual
**       way of selecting the optical case.  Negative values specify
**       frequency in GHz and are the usual way of selecting the radio
**       case.  The transition from optical to radio is assumed to occur
**       at 100 microns (about 3000 GHz).
